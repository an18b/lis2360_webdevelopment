                    <h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
                   <p>Technology has influenced every part of our lives in one way or another and music is no exception to that. Consider all the ways music  has been impacted by technology, from the ease of use, to the accessibility of everything, in addition to the creation of music to the end product and listening to it. Even the small things in between such as recording, editing and manipulating the individual recordings have all been improved due to technology. Music is all around us, and especially on a college campus, there are very few students seen walking to class without their headphones in listening to music. Innovations in the field have allowed us to take music on the go on our phones and have enough music to be able to listen for days or weeks at a time continuously before even hearing the same song again. Since people have been able to communicate and talk, music has been believed to be present and it doesn't look like music is going anywhere as technology only simplifies our ability to make and share music across the world in a matter of seconds. </p>

                <h2><em>Music today</em></h2>
                    
                    <p>Music has come a long way, and has changed a lot even within just the past few decades because of technological advances, but even within the past few years music has changed so much. With the wide availability of music production software, anyone and everyone who is willing to learn and try has the opportunity to make a name for themselves. Just the production software is not enough though, but with the rapid expansion of the internet there are numerous websites that allow you to post your music to be listened to by others. With the popularity of services such as SoundCloud, it is not uncommon to see people record their own music and put it online, then if their popularity grows they can get signed and continue in the industry. Not only are services such as SoundCloud popular for making a name for yourself, but today it has become extremely popular to purchase a subscription to a music streaming service rather than to buy songs or albums individually. Streaming has its advantages including that the music does not have to be stored on your phone and take up space but rather streams through the internet. Additionally, with streaming music, we now have access to a virually limitless library of songs for a monthly price rather than a library based only on the songs we buy.</p>

                <h2><em>History</em></h2>
                <p>Imagine all the ways music is played today and how often you hear it. Radio, TV, online platforms, music streaming and even CDs and vinyls if you are lucky enough to find someone who has any and a way to play them. To consider how music was influenced by technology we must first breifly go over the general history of music before adding in technology. It is difficult to say exactly when music came into the picture but it is believed that around the time humans learned to communicate, they also began using their voices and things such as rocks and wood as primitive instruments. From then, thanks to religion music was further developed mainly vocally until we get to the Renaissance period when instruments were added to the arsenal of composers and writers. From then, music was developed more and more with each passing year and era of music, developing more instruments to produce different sounds and effects. From the early stages of music, written transcripts and a mostly unchanged musical notation and writing, we have preserved music from over a millenia ago, and with technology these early works will be preserved forever.</p>
                <p>One of the first technological pieces to change music as it was know was with the invention of the microphone in 1877 when it was first used to broadcast sounds of scratching insects. Today we use the microphone for everything from talking on the phone, to controlling our homes and smart assistants, to making movies and music of our own. Following the invention of the microphone, in the late 1890's the first radio was constructed to send wireless signals from one device to another, but it was not until 1906 that the first voice messages were sent over the radio (Knell). The next significant development we see is the invention of the headphones in 1910 that would first be used by the navy to listen to signals and messages sent over radio waves before eventually turning into the advanced models we have today by companies such as Apple, Bose, and Sony. To make music more easily distributed first came the LP vinyls in the 1930s that were later replaced by cassettes and 8-track tapes with superior quality in the 1960s making it immensely easier to produce and mass distribute music, speeches and other audio recordings. CDs would later replace the cassettes in the early 1980s for their better storage capacities and improved playback. With these also came portable devices to be able to play the music beginning with the Walkman in the 1980s that later evolved into the CD player, and finally the MP3 player and iPods in the early 2000s. Transitioning to the producer side of things, before AutoTune came out in 1997, there was the Vocoder that came out in 1940 that allowed you to manipulate in almost real time the vocal patterns and audio surrounding vocals. Finally, software such as GarageBand came out in the early 2000s that allowed consumers to be able to make music on their own with little to no equipment in the comfort of their home. These programs provide a wide array of instruments that enable users to simulate a whole orchestra using a keyboard and mouse. </p>
