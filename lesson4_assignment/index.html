        <h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
           <p>Technology has influenced every part of our lives in one way or another and music is no exception to that. Consider all the ways music  has been impacted by technology, from the ease of use, to the accessibility of everything, in addition to the creation of music to the end product and listening to it. Even the small things in between such as recording, editing and manipulating the individual recordings have all been improved due to technology. Music is all around us, and especially on a college campus, there are very few students seen walking to class without their headphones in listening to music. Innovations in the field have allowed us to take music on the go on our phones and have enough music to be able to listen for days or weeks at a time continuously before even hearing the same song again. Since people have been able to communicate and talk, music has been believed to be present and it doesn't look like music is going anywhere as technology only simplifies our ability to make and share music across the world in a matter of seconds. </p>
               
                <h2>Music today</h2>
            <p><em><q>The music technology scene is changing so fast it's hard to keep up.</q></em> - Natasha Bedingfield</p>
            <p>Music has come a long way, and has changed a lot even within just the past few decades because of technological advances, but even within the past few years music has changed so much. With the wide availability of music production software, anyone and everyone who is willing to learn and try has the opportunity to make a name for themselves. Just the production software is not enough though, but with the rapid expansion of the internet there are numerous websites that allow you to post your music to be listened to by others. With the popularity of services such as SoundCloud, it is not uncommon to see people record their own music and put it online, then if their popularity grows they can get signed and continue in the industry. Not only are services such as SoundCloud popular for making a name for yourself, but today it has become extremely popular to purchase a subscription to a music streaming service rather than to buy songs or albums individually. Streaming has its advantages including that the music does not have to be stored on your phone and take up space but rather streams through the internet. Additionally, with streaming music, we now have access to a virually limitless library of songs for a monthly price rather than a library based only on the songs we buy.</p>
