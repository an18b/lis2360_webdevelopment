        <h2><em>History</em></h2>
            <p>Imagine all the ways music is played today and how often you hear it. Radio, TV, online platforms, music streaming and even CDs and vinyls if you are lucky enough to find someone who has any and a way to play them. To consider how music was influenced by technology we must first breifly go over the general history of music before adding in technology. It is difficult to say exactly when music came into the picture but it is believed that around the time humans learned to communicate, they also began using their voices and things such as rocks and wood as primitive instruments. From then, thanks to religion music was further developed mainly vocally until we get to the Renaissance period when instruments were added to the arsenal of composers and writers. From then, music was developed more and more with each passing year and era of music, developing more instruments to produce different sounds and effects. From the early stages of music, written transcripts and a mostly unchanged musical notation and writing, we have preserved music from over a millenia ago, and with technology these early works will be preserved forever.</p>
            <p>One of the first technological pieces to change music as it was know was with the invention of the microphone in 1877 when it was first used to broadcast sounds of scratching insects. Today we use the microphone for everything from talking on the phone, to controlling our homes and smart assistants, to making movies and music of our own. Following the invention of the microphone, in the late 1890's the first radio was constructed to send wireless signals from one device to another, but it was not until 1906 that the first voice messages were sent over the radio (Knell). The next significant development we see is the invention of the headphones in 1910 that would first be used by the navy to listen to signals and messages sent over radio waves before eventually turning into the advanced models we have today by companies such as Apple, Bose, and Sony. To make music more easily distributed first came the LP vinyls in the 1930s that were later replaced by cassettes and 8-track tapes with superior quality in the 1960s making it immensely easier to produce and mass distribute music, speeches and other audio recordings. CDs would later replace the cassettes in the early 1980s for their better storage capacities and improved playback. With these also came portable devices to be able to play the music beginning with the Walkman in the 1980s that later evolved into the CD player, and finally the MP3 player and iPods in the early 2000s. Transitioning to the producer side of things, before AutoTune came out in 1997, there was the Vocoder that came out in 1940 that allowed you to manipulate in almost real time the vocal patterns and audio surrounding vocals. Finally, software such as GarageBand came out in the early 2000s that allowed consumers to be able to make music on their own with little to no equipment in the comfort of their home. These programs provide a wide array of instruments that enable users to simulate a whole orchestra using a keyboard and mouse. </p>
